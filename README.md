# VBA Stock Analysis 

## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this analysis is to refactor code using Microsoft Excel VBA Scripting. The stock information is from 2017 and 2018, and will be used to determine whether or not the stocks are investing in. Refactoring this code is meant to make the code more efficient.

## Results: 
The orignal VBA script was run in the stock_analysis file. The refactored code was run in the stock_analysis_final file. 

- The code ran before refactoring:

- The code ran after refactoring:

## Summary: 

#### Advantages and Disadvantages to Refactoring Code
One advantage of refactoring code is the faster execution. The above photos show the time difference in how the code ran for each year. 
The code can be used again.
Programmers will have to determine if refactoring code is worth the time or if creating new code is more efficient. Sometimes refactoring may take longer.

#### Pros and Cons of Refactoring the Original VBA Script
Refactoring code requires testing of new code, so it can seem like trial and error. 
The new code has less loops, which leads to less processing time and a faster output.
